        In order to ensure the highest quality of services, JSQL has a separate
        portal where the customer has access to his company data, payments,
        subscriptions and invoices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use the portal you should accept the invitation that came to the
        email when you purchased the product and follow the instructions.
